# House_Price_Predicton
 "Comprehensive house price prediction using various features beyond location and size."
## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models. By analyzing features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors, the models can provide an estimate of the house price.

## Problem Statement
A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value. For example, you want to sell a house and you don’t know the price which you may expect — it can’t be too low or too high. To find house price you usually try to find similar properties in your neighborhood and based on gathered data you will try to assess your house price.

## Objective
Take advantage of all of the feature variables available below, use it to analyze and predict house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features of houses. It includes:

- `cid`: a notation for a house
- `dayhours`: Date house was sold
- `price`: Price is prediction target
- `room_bed`: Number of Bedrooms/House
- `room_bath`: Number of bathrooms/bedrooms
- `living_measure`: Square footage of the home
- `lot_measure`: Square footage of the lot
- `ceil`: Total floors (levels) in house
- `coast`: House which has a view to a waterfront
- `sight`: Has been viewed
- `condition`: How good the condition is (Overall)
- `quality`: Grade given to the housing unit, based on grading system
- `ceil_measure`: Square footage of house apart from basement
- `basement_measure`: Square footage of the basement
- `yr_built`: Built Year
- `yr_renovated`: Year when house was renovated
- `zipcode`: ZIP code
- `lat`: Latitude coordinate
- `long`: Longitude coordinate
- `living_measure15`: Living room area in 2015 (implies some renovations)
- `lot_measure15`: Lot size area in 2015 (implies some renovations)
- `furnished`: Based on the quality of room
- `total_area`: Measure of both living and lot

 ##Approach Used
Data Wrangling
Data Collection: Gathered data from the provided dataset which includes various features of houses.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed any irrelevant or duplicate entries.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as total living area and age of the house.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the distribution of features, identified correlations, and visualized important patterns in the data.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the listed questions and aims of this project.
